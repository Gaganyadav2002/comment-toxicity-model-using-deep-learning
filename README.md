# comment-toxicity-model-using-deep-learning
This project addresses the growing need for online content moderation by proposing a toxicity detection model based on deep learning. Our model employs a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and attention mechanisms to identify and filter out toxic content in user-generated text on social media platforms.
